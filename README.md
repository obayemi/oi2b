oi2b
====


obayemi interface to blih, because blih sucks, because you allways forget
someone of your team, because you often forget ramassage-tek, because you
don't want to use the command 'rendu' (if you do, trust me, you don't, just
read it's code and and you won't want much longer), because you
want to be able to clone your repos everywhere but in ~/rendu, because you
want to clone easily your repos on whatever linux distribution, or even
windows accurding you got it a POSIX shell.


# Usage
put oi2b in PATH (or not), then

to create a repo:
	$ oi2b create_repo repo_name

to clone a repo
	$ oi2b get_repo [user/]repo_name


# TODO:
Maybe one day, if I'm not that lazy, I'll do a key uploading utility
